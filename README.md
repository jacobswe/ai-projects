# Jacob's Projects in AI, ML, and Simulations

I am a Senior Data Scientist, and a strong proponent of continuous learning and education. This repository will log my efforts and progress in broadening my data scientific base.

### 1) [Othello AI](https://github.com/jacobswe/ai-projects/tree/main/1_OthelloAI)

This is an attempt at modelling the dynamics of the Othello board game, and then to create refinforcement learning implementations of self-play engines.
