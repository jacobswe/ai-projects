# BERT Classification Templates

For the applied implementation, this is an experiment on the [Disaster Tweets Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview). The goal of the dataset is to classify English tweets into categories of "talking about a disaster" and "not talking about a disaster," the interesting piece being the understanding of more than frequency analysis to understand "I am on fire today" and "The fire is getting closer to me" contextually. My goal in implementing this project is to practice word embedding techniques and to implement the analysis using PyTorch and HuggingFace libraries. Finally, I may also offer (for my own use or yours) some templates to apply this technique in the future.

To download the data (presuming a Bash shell is available), build a virtualenv on the requirements.txt and execute the download.sh shell script to gather and organize the data from the Kaggle CLI.
