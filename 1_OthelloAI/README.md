# Othello Artificial Intelligence

Othello is a two-player board strategy board game, the rules for which can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi).

To operate this in your own environment, create a virtualenv on the requirements.txt. StableBaselines is a standard repository of well-implemented reinforcement learning algorithms that allow for easy (but simple) experiments in self-play approaches to game learning. While there exist strong engines for Othello already, this project is an experiment in the applications of various types of reinforcement learning to the problem and are educational in nature.
